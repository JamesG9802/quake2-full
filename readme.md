# Plants vs Zombies
This is a modified version of Quake 2, originally designed by Id Software, to run a variant of the game known as Plants vs Zombies. Due to the extensive differences between Plants vs Zombies and Quake 2, the executable has been modified. As such, you can only run this mod by launching through our shortcut which will automatically launch our mod. It is possible to mod this executable just like Quake 2, though you may need to examine the engine changes to determine what you can modify.    

## Installation
You can download a working version of this mod through the Releases tab in this repository. Afterwards, you can launch the mod by double clicking the shortcut. 

## Playing the game
Like in Plants vs Zombies, you have a grid where you can place plants to defend yourself from zombies. All plants require sun to be placed. Sun is only produced by sunflowers and intermittently from the sky. You lose the game if zombies manage to travel all the way to your house. Zombies will spawn in increasing number and strength as time progresses. Due to difficulty increases, zombies drop consumable items that can activated with the spacebar.
## Controls
Left Click - place plant
Left and Right Arrows - change currently selected plant in shop.
Escape - pause the game and show a help screen.
Spacebar - activate consumable, if any
You can rebind controls through config.cfg.

- Sunflower: 50 sun | Produces sun.

# Original License terms by Id Software
This is the complete source code for Quake 2, version 3.19, buildable with
visual C++ 6.0.  The linux version should be buildable, but we haven't
tested it for the release.

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).  
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do 
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version.  The catch 
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the 
entire source code available for free to everyone.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational 
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the 
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear 
to have your source changes released, we could still negotiate a separate 
license agreement (for $$$), but I would encourage you to just live with the 
GPL.

All of the Q2 data files remain copyrighted and licensed under the 
original terms, so you cannot redistribute data from the original game, but if 
you do a true total conversion, you can create a standalone game based on 
this code.

Thanks to Robert Duffy for doing the grunt work of building this release.
